Welcome to MomentsOfLife!

To launch this react app, clone this repo and enter 'npm i' then 'npm run start' in your terminal.

App is filled with mock data generated by ts scripts in ./src/utils/mockData.ts. Feel free to explore mock data generation.

To login into the app, use login 'admin', password 'admin'. Those values are hardcoded for testing purposes.
