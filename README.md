Welcome to MomentsOfLife!

To launch this react app, clone this repo and enter 'npm i' then 'npm run start' in your terminal.

To get correct response from your server (https://github.com/PetrMitin/moments_of_life_server.git), either use ready db dump from server git repo or change user_id values in momentsActions.ts, profileActions.ts to one generated by your fill_db script. This is only for testing purposes only.

To login into the app, use email 'admin@admin', password 'admin'. Those values are hardcoded for testing purposes.

Tech stack: Typescript, React, Redux, SASS/SCSS, React-Bootstrap.
